~1.0~conclusions~1~the ibm dsd technical information center - a total systems approach
combining traditional library features
and mechanized computer processing
~H. S. WHITE
~the ibm data systems division technical
 information center (tic) provides an operating developmental
system for integrated and compatible mechanized
 processing of technical information received within the organization.
  the system offers several advantages :
     1 . it is a sophisticated mechanized system for dissemination
and retrieval;
     2 . it is compatible with all library mechanized
  records produced under a standard processing format
  within ibm libraries, providing such traditional tools
  as 3 x 5 catalog cards, circulation records and overdue
notices;
     3 . it is reversible, so that discontinuation of machine
processing would not cause gaps in the library's
  manual records;
     4 . it is controlled, producing statistical evaluations
of its own program efficiency;
     5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access
and immediate microfilm access to its documents;
     6 . it is relatively simple, relying on the ibm 1401
  data processing system for all its processing and output.

  since the system has been operating for over a year, the
conclusions drawn are based on actual experience .
~1.0~encoders~14~educational requirements for indexers in a selective dissemination
system
~A. RESNICK
~an experiment was conducted in the sdi
 system at ibm-asdd to determine if the educational level
 of the encoder had a significant effect on the percentage
 of notifications regarded as relevant by the users .  considering
all 800 documents encoded, high school educated
 encoders had a significantly higher percentage of their
 notices regarded as relevant than did four college educated
 encoders .  eliminating documents for which no notifications
were sent, no significant difference was found between
the high school and college level encoders .
~1.0~rendering~47~retrieval and the general library .
~D. CROSLAND
~the retrieval problems of a general library tend to differ from those
of special libraries .  the automation of information or document

of the tedious clerical work involved in rendering traditional
library services .
~1.0~indexer~28~the role of thesauri in the convergence of word and concept
indexing .
~S. HERNER
~the increase in indexing vocabularies guiding
the use of terms and indicating their relationship has

~1.0~programing~66~linear vs. inverted file searching on serial access machines .
~S. N. JACOBSON
~based on a comparison of : 1. existing systems;
2. tape processing; 3. internal functions; and 4. file
 maintenance problems, a linear file organization is found
 to be superior to an inverted one for searching on tape oriented
computer systems .  programing sophistication and
 machine configuration can change this relationship only in
 degree .
~1.0~feasibility~5~feasibility criteria for establishing specialized information centers
~Unknown
~some guidelines are presented for estimating
the practicability of establishing specialized information

~1.0~machine~1~the ibm dsd technical information center - a total systems approach
combining traditional library features
and mechanized computer processing
~H. S. WHITE
~the ibm data systems division technical
 information center (tic) provides an operating developmental
system for integrated and compatible mechanized
 processing of technical information received within the organization.
  the system offers several advantages :
     1 . it is a sophisticated mechanized system for dissemination
and retrieval;
     2 . it is compatible with all library mechanized
  records produced under a standard processing format
  within ibm libraries, providing such traditional tools
  as 3 x 5 catalog cards, circulation records and overdue
notices;
     3 . it is reversible, so that discontinuation of machine
processing would not cause gaps in the library's
  manual records;
     4 . it is controlled, producing statistical evaluations
of its own program efficiency;
     5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access
and immediate microfilm access to its documents;
     6 . it is relatively simple, relying on the ibm 1401
  data processing system for all its processing and output.

 citation to satisfy the request .  the resultant file which is
 reduced in size is then passed against a decision table for
 the final selection of citations .  the report generator
 module formats the citations of printer paper, cards, or
 photograph film .  the output processing module formats
index medicus and recurring bibliographies, which
 are automatically updated by the system .  the final output
 is processed by the graphic arts composing equipment
 for later printing .
