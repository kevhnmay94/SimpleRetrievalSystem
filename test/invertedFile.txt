~1.2758759015891443~year~1~the ibm dsd technical information center - a total systems approach
combining traditional library features
and mechanized computer processing
~H. S. WHITE
~the ibm data systems division technical
 information center (tic) provides an operating developmental
system for integrated and compatible mechanized
 processing of technical information received within the organization.
  the system offers several advantages :
     1 . it is a sophisticated mechanized system for dissemination
and retrieval;
     2 . it is compatible with all library mechanized
  records produced under a standard processing format
  within ibm libraries, providing such traditional tools
  as 3 x 5 catalog cards, circulation records and overdue
notices;
     3 . it is reversible, so that discontinuation of machine
processing would not cause gaps in the library's
  manual records;
     4 . it is controlled, producing statistical evaluations
of its own program efficiency;
     5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access
and immediate microfilm access to its documents;
     6 . it is relatively simple, relying on the ibm 1401
  data processing system for all its processing and output.

  since the system has been operating for over a year, the
conclusions drawn are based on actual experience .

~H. S. WHITE
~the ibm data systems division technical
 information center (tic) provides an operating developmental
system for integrated and compatible mechanized
 processing of technical information received within the organization.
  the system offers several advantages :
     1 . it is a sophisticated mechanized system for dissemination
and retrieval;
     2 . it is compatible with all library mechanized
  records produced under a standard processing format
  within ibm libraries, providing such traditional tools
  as 3 x 5 catalog cards, circulation records and overdue
notices;
     3 . it is reversible, so that discontinuation of machine
processing would not cause gaps in the library's
  manual records;
     4 . it is controlled, producing statistical evaluations
of its own program efficiency;
     5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access
and immediate microfilm access to its documents;
     6 . it is relatively simple, relying on the ibm 1401
  data processing system for all its processing and output.

~H. S. WHITE
~the ibm data systems division technical
 information center (tic) provides an operating developmental
system for integrated and compatible mechanized
 processing of technical information received within the organization.
  the system offers several advantages :
     1 . it is a sophisticated mechanized system for dissemination
and retrieval;
     2 . it is compatible with all library mechanized
  records produced under a standard processing format
  within ibm libraries, providing such traditional tools
  as 3 x 5 catalog cards, circulation records and overdue
notices;
     3 . it is reversible, so that discontinuation of machine
processing would not cause gaps in the library's
  manual records;
     4 . it is controlled, producing statistical evaluations
of its own program efficiency;
     5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access
and immediate microfilm access to its documents;
     6 . it is relatively simple, relying on the ibm 1401
  data processing system for all its processing and output.

  since the system has been operating for over a year, the
conclusions drawn are based on actual experience .

     2 . it is compatible with all library mechanized
  records produced under a standard processing format
  within ibm libraries, providing such traditional tools
  as 3 x 5 catalog cards, circulation records and overdue
notices;
     3 . it is reversible, so that discontinuation of machine
processing would not cause gaps in the library's
  manual records;
     4 . it is controlled, producing statistical evaluations
of its own program efficiency;
     5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access
and immediate microfilm access to its documents;

~0.9838153957918157~reli~1~the ibm dsd technical information center - a total systems approach
combining traditional library features
and mechanized computer processing
~H. S. WHITE
~the ibm data systems division technical
 information center (tic) provides an operating developmental
system for integrated and compatible mechanized
 processing of technical information received within the organization.
  the system offers several advantages :
     1 . it is a sophisticated mechanized system for dissemination
and retrieval;
     2 . it is compatible with all library mechanized
  records produced under a standard processing format
  within ibm libraries, providing such traditional tools
  as 3 x 5 catalog cards, circulation records and overdue
notices;
     3 . it is reversible, so that discontinuation of machine
processing would not cause gaps in the library's
  manual records;
     4 . it is controlled, producing statistical evaluations
of its own program efficiency;
     5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access
and immediate microfilm access to its documents;
     6 . it is relatively simple, relying on the ibm 1401
  data processing system for all its processing and output.

  since the system has been operating for over a year, the

~H. S. WHITE
~the ibm data systems division technical
 information center (tic) provides an operating developmental
system for integrated and compatible mechanized
 processing of technical information received within the organization.
  the system offers several advantages :
     1 . it is a sophisticated mechanized system for dissemination
and retrieval;
     2 . it is compatible with all library mechanized
  records produced under a standard processing format
  within ibm libraries, providing such traditional tools
  as 3 x 5 catalog cards, circulation records and overdue
notices;
     3 . it is reversible, so that discontinuation of machine
processing would not cause gaps in the library's
  manual records;
     4 . it is controlled, producing statistical evaluations
of its own program efficiency;
     5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access
and immediate microfilm access to its documents;
     6 . it is relatively simple, relying on the ibm 1401
  data processing system for all its processing and output.

~H. S. WHITE
~the ibm data systems division technical
 information center (tic) provides an operating developmental
system for integrated and compatible mechanized
 processing of technical information received within the organization.
  the system offers several advantages :
     1 . it is a sophisticated mechanized system for dissemination
and retrieval;
     2 . it is compatible with all library mechanized
  records produced under a standard processing format
  within ibm libraries, providing such traditional tools
  as 3 x 5 catalog cards, circulation records and overdue
notices;
     3 . it is reversible, so that discontinuation of machine
processing would not cause gaps in the library's
  manual records;
     4 . it is controlled, producing statistical evaluations
of its own program efficiency;
     5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access
and immediate microfilm access to its documents;

~H. S. WHITE
~the ibm data systems division technical
 information center (tic) provides an operating developmental
system for integrated and compatible mechanized
 processing of technical information received within the organization.
  the system offers several advantages :
     1 . it is a sophisticated mechanized system for dissemination
and retrieval;
     2 . it is compatible with all library mechanized
  records produced under a standard processing format
  within ibm libraries, providing such traditional tools
  as 3 x 5 catalog cards, circulation records and overdue
notices;
     3 . it is reversible, so that discontinuation of machine
processing would not cause gaps in the library's
  manual records;
     4 . it is controlled, producing statistical evaluations
of its own program efficiency;
     5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access
and immediate microfilm access to its documents;
     6 . it is relatively simple, relying on the ibm 1401
  data processing system for all its processing and output.

  since the system has been operating for over a year, the
conclusions drawn are based on actual experience .

~H. S. WHITE
~the ibm data systems division technical
 information center (tic) provides an operating developmental
system for integrated and compatible mechanized
 processing of technical information received within the organization.
  the system offers several advantages :
     1 . it is a sophisticated mechanized system for dissemination
and retrieval;
     2 . it is compatible with all library mechanized
  records produced under a standard processing format
  within ibm libraries, providing such traditional tools
  as 3 x 5 catalog cards, circulation records and overdue
notices;
     3 . it is reversible, so that discontinuation of machine
processing would not cause gaps in the library's
  manual records;
     4 . it is controlled, producing statistical evaluations
of its own program efficiency;
     5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access
and immediate microfilm access to its documents;
     6 . it is relatively simple, relying on the ibm 1401
  data processing system for all its processing and output.

  since the system has been operating for over a year, the
conclusions drawn are based on actual experience .

of its own program efficiency;
     5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access
and immediate microfilm access to its documents;

  the system offers several advantages :
     1 . it is a sophisticated mechanized system for dissemination
and retrieval;
     2 . it is compatible with all library mechanized
  records produced under a standard processing format
  within ibm libraries, providing such traditional tools
  as 3 x 5 catalog cards, circulation records and overdue
notices;

~H. S. WHITE
~the ibm data systems division technical
 information center (tic) provides an operating developmental
system for integrated and compatible mechanized
 processing of technical information received within the organization.
  the system offers several advantages :
     1 . it is a sophisticated mechanized system for dissemination
and retrieval;
     2 . it is compatible with all library mechanized
  records produced under a standard processing format
  within ibm libraries, providing such traditional tools
  as 3 x 5 catalog cards, circulation records and overdue
notices;
     3 . it is reversible, so that discontinuation of machine
processing would not cause gaps in the library's
  manual records;
     4 . it is controlled, producing statistical evaluations
of its own program efficiency;
     5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access
and immediate microfilm access to its documents;
     6 . it is relatively simple, relying on the ibm 1401

~H. S. WHITE
~the ibm data systems division technical
 information center (tic) provides an operating developmental
system for integrated and compatible mechanized
 processing of technical information received within the organization.
  the system offers several advantages :
     1 . it is a sophisticated mechanized system for dissemination
and retrieval;
     2 . it is compatible with all library mechanized
  records produced under a standard processing format
  within ibm libraries, providing such traditional tools
  as 3 x 5 catalog cards, circulation records and overdue
notices;
     3 . it is reversible, so that discontinuation of machine
processing would not cause gaps in the library's
  manual records;
     4 . it is controlled, producing statistical evaluations
of its own program efficiency;
     5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access
and immediate microfilm access to its documents;
     6 . it is relatively simple, relying on the ibm 1401
  data processing system for all its processing and output.

  since the system has been operating for over a year, the
conclusions drawn are based on actual experience .

combining traditional library features
and mechanized computer processing
~H. S. WHITE
~the ibm data systems division technical
 information center (tic) provides an operating developmental
system for integrated and compatible mechanized
 processing of technical information received within the organization.
  the system offers several advantages :
     1 . it is a sophisticated mechanized system for dissemination
and retrieval;
     2 . it is compatible with all library mechanized
  records produced under a standard processing format
  within ibm libraries, providing such traditional tools
  as 3 x 5 catalog cards, circulation records and overdue
notices;
     3 . it is reversible, so that discontinuation of machine
processing would not cause gaps in the library's
  manual records;
     4 . it is controlled, producing statistical evaluations
of its own program efficiency;
     5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access
and immediate microfilm access to its documents;
     6 . it is relatively simple, relying on the ibm 1401
  data processing system for all its processing and output.

  since the system has been operating for over a year, the
conclusions drawn are based on actual experience .

     2 . it is compatible with all library mechanized
  records produced under a standard processing format
  within ibm libraries, providing such traditional tools
  as 3 x 5 catalog cards, circulation records and overdue
notices;

of its own program efficiency;
     5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access
and immediate microfilm access to its documents;

     2 . it is compatible with all library mechanized
  records produced under a standard processing format
  within ibm libraries, providing such traditional tools
  as 3 x 5 catalog cards, circulation records and overdue
notices;
     3 . it is reversible, so that discontinuation of machine
processing would not cause gaps in the library's
  manual records;
     4 . it is controlled, producing statistical evaluations
of its own program efficiency;
     5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access
and immediate microfilm access to its documents;
     6 . it is relatively simple, relying on the ibm 1401
  data processing system for all its processing and output.

  the system offers several advantages :
     1 . it is a sophisticated mechanized system for dissemination
and retrieval;
     2 . it is compatible with all library mechanized
  records produced under a standard processing format
  within ibm libraries, providing such traditional tools
  as 3 x 5 catalog cards, circulation records and overdue
notices;
     3 . it is reversible, so that discontinuation of machine
processing would not cause gaps in the library's
  manual records;
     4 . it is controlled, producing statistical evaluations
of its own program efficiency;
     5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access
and immediate microfilm access to its documents;
     6 . it is relatively simple, relying on the ibm 1401
  data processing system for all its processing and output.

notices;
     3 . it is reversible, so that discontinuation of machine
processing would not cause gaps in the library's
  manual records;

of its own program efficiency;
     5 . it is user-oriented, providing 24-hour copy access
and immediate microfilm access to its documents;
