The standard indexed version of the npl collection that has been floating
around for years is in
	indexed_npl.doc
	indexed_npl.query
	indexed_npl.rel
Bruce Croft and Karen Spark-Jones dug up the original text form of the
collection which is in 
	npl.dat
	npl.qry
	npl.rel
(Both forms are document file, query file, relevance judgement file)
