Files included in this INSPEC Collection archive:

  inspec.dat 

    The INSPEC document collection.


  inspec.q 

    INSPEC queries in a form suitable for submission to the INQUERY evaluation
    program, "inqueryb" or "inqr-b"


  inspec.queries.orig

    INSPEC query set in original "dot" format.


  inspec.rel

    INSPEC relevance judgements for each query in the set.  This is current
    INQUERY relevance format suitable for submission to the "inqueryb"
    evaluation program.


  inspec.rel.old

    INSPEC relevance judgements using the "old" INQUERY format.  This format
    was used on pre-2.0 versions of INQUERY and is no longer valid.


The collection is in what we call, "dot format".  If you are using INQUERY to
index this collection using "inparse" or "inbuild", use the "cacm_dots"
document translator as the document type.
